CLOCK(C)                    TO-D/OS MODULE Documents                    CLOCK(C)

NAME
    clock - keep track of the passage of time

SYNOPSIS
  - Initializes the PIT
  - Handles all clock ticks
  - Preempts tasks which have run for too long
  - Prints a nice pretty pinwheel
  - Wakes sleeping processes so that they are not late to their finals

DESCRIPTION
    The clock module is responsible for keeping the system moving along. It
    uses the 8253 Programmable Interrupt Timer (set to 1KHz) to allow the OS
    to handle periodic tasks. The most important of these is the preemption of
    userspace processes. It also keeps track of the passage of time (useful
    for sleeping processes) and updates a spinning pinwheel.

GLOBALS
    extern time_t _system_time
        The current system time in milliseconds since system boot.

EXPOSED FUNCTIONALITY
    void _clock_init(void)
        Initializes the clock hardware and registers the ISR
