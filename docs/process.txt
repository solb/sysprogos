PROCESS(C)                  TO-D/OS MODULE Documents                  PROCESS(C)

NAME
    process - Process-related bookkeeping structures (namely PCBs)

SYNOPSIS
  - Defines constants related to userspace processes: their states,
    priorities, PIDs, number of memory pages, and stack address
  - Provides structures to represent PCBs and process contexts
  - Implements functions for allocating and returning PCBs, as well as for
    dumping debug information from PCBs and contexts

DATA STRUCTURES
    typedef struct pcb_t;
        Represents a PCB (Process Control Block) consisting of the PID, parent
        PID, priority, state, remaining execution time, context save area. It
        also includes the physical address of the per-process page table and a
        processor to the parent processor's PCB. The latter two fields were
        added recently: Per-process protection tables are part of the dynamic
        memory portion of the protection project, whose goal was to ensure
        that only one userspace process would have its memory mapped at a
        time. The parent PCB pointer was added to support implementation of
        the syncspawn() syscall, is only populated in the PCBs of
        processes that were spawned by this means, and is only used by the
        _terminate() function in the scheduler module. Spare PCBs are stored
		in a queue until allocated, then put back there once freed.

    typedef struct context_t;
        Stores a process's general-purpose registers, CS and SS segment
        registers, stack pointer, instruction pointer, RFLAGS control
        register, and interrupt code and vector. This information is stored on
        top of userspace processes' stacks, which means that only the one
        corresponding to the currently-executing process is accessible without
        the manual mapping of a stack page and a fair amount of pointer
        arithmetic. This structure was changed significantly during the 64-bit
        porting process to accomodate the greatly increased number of
        general-purpose registers.

EXPOSED FUNCTIONALITY
	void _pcb_init(void);
		Initializes all PCB-related data structures

	pcb_t *_pcb_alloc(void);
		Allocates a PCB structure
		Returns NULL on failure

	void _pcb_free(pcb_t *);
		Returns an unneeded PCB for later reuse

	void _pcb_dump(const char *which, pcb_t *pcb);
		Dumps the contents of a PCB to the console
