SIO(C)                      TO-D/OS MODULE Documents                      SIO(C)

NAME
    sio - read and write to the serial console

SYNOPSIS
  - Reads characters from the console
  - Processes are put on a blocked queue when they read but no data is
    available.
  - Writes individual characters and strings
  - Buffers input and output

DESCRIPTION
    The sio module is responsible for communication to and from the serial
    console. It maintains 2 ring buffers of characters, one for input and one
    for output. It provides an interface for characters to be read ior writtem
    one at a time or from a NUL-terminated string buffer.

    This module remains almost entirely unchanged from the base system, save
    for a buffer overflow bug fix in _sio_writec.

    int _sio_reads(char *buffer, int length)
