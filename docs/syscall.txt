SYSCALL(C)                  TO-D/OS MODULE Documents                  SYSCALL(C)

NAME
    syscall - Kernel-level backing syscall implementations

SYNOPSIS
  - Handles incoming syscalls arriving from userland
  - Maintains a record of the SLEEPING processes desiring timed rescheduling

DESCRIPTION
    This module only receives control flow when it is first initialized, and
    thereafter only when userland requests a syscall. It does not define any
    data structures, and the only state data it exposes is the queue of
    sleeping processes, which it shares with the clock module.

GLOBALS
    queue_t _sleeping
        The queue of processes waiting to be woken up at specific times; these
        processes will be _schedule()d by the clock module at that point

EXPOSED FUNCTIONALITY
    void _sys_init(void)
        Initializes the module, linking the syscall codes to their
        implementing routines, installing its own ISR to invoke those, and
        initializing its sleeping queue
