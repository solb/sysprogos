SYSTEM(C)                   TO-D/OS MODULE Documents                   SYSTEM(C)

NAME
    system - Get the system up and running and initialize new processes

SYNOPSIS
  - Performs the initialization of the other modules before spawning and
    handing execution off to the userspace init binary
  - Sets up processes, including copying them from the ramdisk to memory

DESCRIPTION
    This module is responsible for getting processes ready to load, whether
    that's getting the kernel ready to support userland's init or getting
    another one set up to share the CPU time.

EXPOSED FUNCTIONALITY
    void _init(void)
        Called by the startup code immediately before returning into the first
        user process, and responsible for initializing the kernel and setting
        the userspace init process up for successful successorship

    pcb_t *_create_process(pid_t ppid, const char *path)
        Given a filename, set up a process image by initializing a PCB and
        populating a page table with entries to a bunch of preallocated
        per-process pages to which userland is allowed access
        The returned PCB is ready to be _schedule()d, unless there was a
        problem, in which case it is NULL, likely indicating that the binary
        file couldn't be found
