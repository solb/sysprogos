Systems Programming II: Project Milestone Definition
04/09/14

Our projects:
	- Sol:	Privilege isolation of user-space processes within single pages
	- Chris:Filesystem
	- Dan:	64-bit kernel port

Between now and midpoint eval:
	- Dan and Sol will be in communication about changes made to the PCB and similar kernel design
	- Chris will record his changes to the syscall interface

04/30 Midpoint eval:
	- Dan should have the base kernel relatively stable in long mode
	- Sol should have 1-page process loading working, privilege isolation semi-secure
	- Chris should be able to read/write/create/delete files, but not necessarily directories
	- Ideally, Sol and Chris's projects will be partially merged into long mode

05/07 Implementation complete:
	- Sol and Chris's projects should be considered code-complete and fully merged into 64-bit

05/11 Presentation ready:
	- We're ready to present for the next day

Finals week demo:
	- All testing is complete
